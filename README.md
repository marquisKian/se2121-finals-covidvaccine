Actually, I was confused at first on where to import data from the downloads since my cvs files weren't reading correctly. I tried pg admin and it worked correctly and I was about to code the procedures and the functions when I asked my classmate how to code a certain procedure, they said that pg admin wasn't allowed to be used. So I made the decision to re-work my entire process (including the screenshots for proof) from my two days of research and coding.  

I will continue to refine the code for tomorrow...
